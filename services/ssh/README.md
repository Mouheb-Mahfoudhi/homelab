🔐 SSH Key-Based Authentication Setup

This is how I set up key-only SSH access between my desktop (client) and laptop (server) to allow secure, passwordless connections within my homelab.
The setup ensures encrypted communication, no password-based logins, and uses the modern Ed25519 key algorithm.
